# Capstone News App - Jetpack Compose

The original of this project is [Capstone News App](https://github.com/AscentionOne/CapstoneNewsApp) which is written in legacy View system + Kotlin. This project is complete rewritten in Compose(a modern toolkit for building native UI) and Kotlin. However, the app has the same functionalities as the original one. The purpose of the project is to adopt best practices of Modern Android Development(MAD) skills and demonstrate that I have the knowledge and can convert a View system project into using Jetpack Compose.

Android team at Google provide great support for popular library e.g. ViewModel, LiveData, Flow, Hilt (dependency injection)

## üè† Architecture

The beauty of Jetpack Compose is it work seemlessly with the architecture that developer is used to in create View system application. The most classic one is MVVM. Since in the original project is using MVVM here I will keep it the same. To know more about MVVM please check [Capstone News App](https://github.com/AscentionOne/CapstoneNewsApp).

Here I follow the common architecture principle recommended by Google.

**Separation of concern**: keep the business logic in the data layer(repository) and UIs in the UI layer(Composable functions)

**Single source of truth(SSOT)**: in this application I am using **Room database** as my SSOT. It is best practice to update the UIs only from immutable SSOT data. This keeps the data centralized and make changes to the data traceable and make bugs easier to spot.

**Unidirectional data flow**: unidirectional data flow (UDF) is a design pattern in which **state flows down** and **events flow up**. Where the updated UI state is reflected in the UI layer and the incoming event updates the UI state in **state holder**(ViewModel). This makes state decouple from the composable functions and makes it easier to test. Also less likely to create bug due to inconsistent state(state is updated in the composable function).

For more information you can check my notes [here](https://github.com/AscentionOne/android-documentation/blob/master/android_notes.md#unidirectional-data-flow)

## ‚ú® UI

Compose is a declarative way of creating modern UI as appose to View-based UIs, which is imperetive. Compose let developer create UIs faster and cleaner so developers can focus more on the business logic and the architecture of the app. Android studio also provides **Compose Preview** (since Dolphin), **Multipreview** and **Live Edit** (Electric Eel) functionalities.

- **Compose preview**: let developer see the compose in the design view without needed to run the app. It also provides multiple options for custom configuration of the device.
- **Multipreview**: let developer quickly create group of previews for multiple device configurations. For example, adapt for different screen size.
- **Live edit**: in Dolphin version developer need to manually refresh the preview after making changes in composable function, but now in Electric Eel version preview update automatically.

Above all features makes developer iterate through UIs faster.

## üß± State

Updating UIs is a bit different in Compose, instead of updating the UIs by getting the view ids first then mutate them, compose recreate the whole UI based on the different state. This is called **recomposition**.

State in compose is usually manage by state holder, which is usually **ViewModel**, in the UI layer. The state is stored in an observable data types, e.g. StateFlow, Flow and LiveData and observed as **State**. When the value in the State changes (`State.value`) compose recompose those parts of the UI where `State.value` is used. This is also known as **Smart Recomposition**.

## üß≠ Navigation

As compare to the original project I am using `Intent` to navigate between screen. Here I am using **Jetpack Navigation component**. The Navigation component also provides support for Jetpack compose application.

Things to be aware is, if you are mixing **Compose** and **View** in your app it is recommend to use Fragment-based Navigation component. Where your create the Navigation graph in XML. If you are creating a fully composed app you define a navigation graph with a `NavHost` using Compose destination (composable()).

In this project I also perform navigation testing to demonstrate how to test navigation in compose.

For more information about Navigation in Compose you can check my notes [here](https://github.com/AscentionOne/android-documentation/blob/master/android_notes.md#navigating-with-compose)
